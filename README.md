- Counts how much time has passed since a selected date.
- Displays the elapsed time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Shows a heading like:  
  `Time passed since 13 May 2025`

## 2. Countdown Timer
- Counts down to a selected date and time.
- Displays remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Shows a custom heading (editable from the settings menu).
